We settled on Wiggio to take the meetings on Skype because it features good chat functions and video calls, screen sharing. When we successfully connect to the meeting the very first thing we did, was getting know with each other in an introductory round.

The second thing was to select slack for communication, we select slack because is dedicated for this kind of projects and teams. I set up a team on slack: \href{https://remc17white.slack.com}{remc17white.slack.com}, I did it because I have it experience with slack in the past.

We talked between each other about what we have to do, in order to be sure that everybody understood the course requirements.

The colleagues from Germany have found an implementation of code for collecting the tweets they also  described
in a presentation. I also contributed with a tool for scanning the facebook profile.

\textbf{New theme for the project}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We discussed (promoted by Bogdan), in the following,
	the possibility to choose other theme for the project which
	only Twitter would be necessary.
	\item 	It was mentioned a current topic which a game called
	Blue Whale was influencing people to suicide
	\item One of the suggestions was to use Twitter to find
	possible suicides (not necessarily influenced by the game)
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Agreement:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The conclusion about the suggestion was it could be too
	complicated to label these messages
	\item Requires knowledge and research in topics we don't
	know (e.g. Psychology)
\end{itemize}

Paul suggested that we could also use another web application, which is called "sentiment vz" insted of keyhole.
The problem was that this application is solely
retrieving data from Twitter, and this is a problem to
accomplish our project goal, which is to compare the
sentimental analysis from two different social
platforms
For the topic, which we wanted to use for collecting the
data, we were discussing about current events in the Brexit or the happenings in Syria.
Another topic we were discussing was the French
presidential election. A possible problem of this
problem could be that most of the data might be in
French, which make it difficult to analyze, since most of
the sentimental analyses work with the English
language.

some useless comments due to useless content in the video.
