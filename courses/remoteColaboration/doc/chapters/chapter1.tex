The society has evolved so much, that whether we like it or not, nowadays we cannot escape from technology. It represents an indispensable part of our lives, making our day by day tasks easier. Technology is encountered in various forms all around us, in every domain: business, communication, education, health, transportation etc. 
Over the past years, given the advanced technology remote collaboration has become more and more common. Large projects are being developed in teams across various physical locations. This is happening because more and more companies decide to conduct business online. 
This report covers my documentation of the virtual team meetings regarding the online course Remote Collaboration in Virtual Teams. The course consisted of a six week remote collaboration between students from the master program Software Engineering and Management (MSEM) in Heilbronn, Germany and the master program Mobile and Internet Technologies in E-Business (MITB) at Transilvania University in Brașov, Romania. Students from both universities were mixed in different teams in order to develop a scientific paper about social platforms.

\section{Description of online meetings}
Having to work in a team with new people in order to meet a common goal might be difficult at the beginning, not knowing exactly how to interact with them, having no idea what kind of persons they are. Belonging to different nationalities, thus handling different cultural issues and having to speak in a foreign language might make it a little bit even more problematic. Add on top of that the fact that the collaboration takes place virtually.


\section{Documentation of the collaboration }
In my opinion, the communication among our team went good. We faced all problems that could have done our collaboration difficult: from the typical technical problems to the language barrier problems (given the fact that English is not the mother tongue of any of us). Sometimes it was hard but with patience and control we managed to have a successful collaboration.
The means of communication that we used while working at this project were: Skype, Wiggio, Slack

\subsection{Wiggio}
Wiggio is a web application with focus on team collaboration. This web application helped us tracking the discussions on the news feed, remaining in contact with other team members, finding out news from professor, solving and answering questions and discussing other topics regarding the project. This mean of communication was the most important because from here we found out the most important news and updates about the project.

According to the website's About page: "We developed Wiggio out of our own frustrations with working in groups. We were tired of sending eleven emails back and forth to set a meeting time. We were fed up with "that guy" who just never knows where and when to be for meetings. We were tired of multiple mailing lists, contact books, phone-chains and incompatibilities. We wanted everything to be in one place, and we wanted it simple."
Wiggio Beta was introduced to the Cornell campus in Spring 2008 and attracted about 1500 users. The public beta launch was September 15, 2008. Wiggio had about 5000 users as of September 17, 2008. Wiggio is one of the first companies to have participated in Cornell's ELAB accelerator program.

\subsection{Skype}
For the additional meeting we chose Skype, because it had the best sound quality. Even with this “best” sound quality understanding each other from technical point of view was sometimes hard because of poor internet connection, background noise or other technical problems.

\subsection{Slack}
Slack is a cloud-based set of team collaboration tools and services, founded by Stewart Butterfield. Slack began as an internal tool used by their company, Tiny Speck, in the development of Glitch, a now defunct online game. The name is an acronym for "Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge".

\textbf{History}
Slack was launched in August 2013. In January 2015, Slack announced the acquisition of Screenhero.
In March 2015, Slack announced that it was hacked over the course of four days in February 2015, and that some number of users’ data was compromised. That data included email addresses, usernames, encrypted passwords, and, in some cases, phone numbers and Skype IDs that users had associated with their accounts. In response, Slack added two-factor authentication to their service.

\textbf{Features}

While no longer using an IRC backend, Slack offers a lot of IRC-like features: persistent chat rooms (channels) organized by topic, as well as private groups and direct messaging (again, historically based on IRC). All content inside Slack is searchable, including files, conversations, and people. Slack integrates with a large number of third-party services and supports community-built integrations. Major integrations include services such as Google Drive, Trello, Dropbox, Box, Heroku, IBM Bluemix, Crashlytics, GitHub, Runscope and Zendesk. In December 2015, Slack announced their app directory, consisting of over 150 integrations that users can install. Users can add emoji buttons to their messages, which other users can then click on to express their reactions to messages.

\textbf{Teams
}

Slack teams allow communities, groups, or teams to join through a specific URL or invitation sent by a team admin or owner. Although Slack was meant for organizational communication, it has been slowly turning into a community platform, a function for which users had previously used message boards or social media such as Facebook or LinkedIn groups. Many of these communities are categorized by topics which a group of people may be interested in discussing.

\textbf{Messaging}

Public channels allow team members to communicate without the use of email or group SMS (texting). They are open to everyone in the chat provided they have first been invited to join the client. Private channels allow for private conversation between smaller sects of the overall group. These can be used to break up large teams into their own respective projects. Direct messages allow users to send private messages to a specific user rather than a group of people. Direct messages can include up to nine people (the originator plus eight people). Once started this direct message group can be converted to a private channel.
